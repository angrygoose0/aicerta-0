Keep in mind, one user answer might be trying to fulfil multiple criteria, ones you may or may not be given, and so the evidence may be more detailed than needed.\n    Just focus on if the specific criteria you are on is fulfilled by the user answers you are given.\n\n    When processing the input text, please pay special attention to patterns that match the LaTeX notation for inline and display equations, to ensure accurate processing of mathematical content.\n\n    Your response should be given as JSON.\n    {\"criteria\":[{\"no\":<criteria number>,\"confidence\":<confidence number>,\"explanation\":\"<explanation>\",\"quotes\":{\"<question id>\":\"<quote>\"}}]}\n\n    - Criteria Number (no): The number of the criteria being evaluated.\n    - Confidence Number (confidence): A number from 0 to 100 representing how confident you are that the USER answer fulfills the criteria. A score of 0 means you are completely confident the answer is wrong, and a score of 100 means you are 100% confident the answer is correct.\n    - Explanation (explanation): A detailed explanation of why you gave the confidence number you did.\n    - Quotes (quotes): A dictionary where each key is a question identifier and each value is a direct quote from the USER answer that fulfills the criteria. This direct quote must be accurate(punctuation and spaces)\n    NOTE: if a quote in the answer is seperated (so there are mutliple parts in the answer that qualifies the criteria), create multiple seperate JSON quote objects.\n\n    Here is an example of a possible user input:\n    Model Answer:\n    (a)(i):\n    The capital of New Zealand is Auckland.\n    (b)(i):\n    Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\n    (b)(ii):\n    Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\n    (c)(i):\n    The Earth revolves around the Sun.\n\n    User Answer:\n    (a)(i):\n    The capital of New Zealand is Tauranga.\n    (b)(i):\n    At standard pressure, water freezes at 0\u00b0C.\n    (b)(ii): \n    At standard pressure, water boils at 100\u00b0C.\n    (c)(i): The Earth likes to revolve.\n\n    Criteria:\n    1: States that the capital of New Zealand is Auckland.\n    2: States that water boils at 100 degrees celsius, and freezes at 0 degreese celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\n    3: States that the Earth revolves around the Sun.\n\n\n    Here is an example of the output:\n    {\"criteria\":[{\"no\":1,\"confidence\":0,\"explanation\":\"The response was completely incorrect, as the capital of New Zealand is NOT Tauranga.\",\"quotes\":{\"(a)(i)\":\"The capital of New Zealand is Tauranga.\"}},{\"no\":2,\"confidence\":100,\"explanation\":\"The response was completely correct, as the user states that water boils at 100 degrees celsius, and freezes at 0 degrees celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\",\"quotes\":{\"(b)(i)\":\"At 0 degrees Celsius, water,\",(b)(i)\":\"solidifying into ice under the influence of standard atmospheric pressure.\",\"(b)(ii)\":\"At standard pressure, water boils at 100\u00b0C\"}},{\"no\":3,\"confidence\":20,\"explanation\":\"The response states that the earth revolves but doesn't state around what.\",\"quotes\":{\"(c)(i)\":\"The Earth likes to revolve.\"}}]}\n    This JSON should be outputted as unformatted and with minimal whitespace.\n    "

        "content": "Model Answer: \n(c)(ii): \nIn discussion accept H+ or H3O+.  As the Cu(OH)2 is added, the HCl is being neutralised as water is formed.  When no Cu(OH)2 is added, the universal indicator paper is red and has pH 1\u20132 because there is an excess of H+ ions.  While the Cu(OH)2 is being added, there is still an excess of H+ ions, but not as big. The pH is 4\u20135.  The paper is orange as the solution is still slightly acidic.  When the numbers of H+ and OH\u2013 ions are equal, the solution is neutralised, the paper is green and the pH is 7.  As more Cu(OH)2 is added, the universal indicator paper is now blue. The solution has an excess of OH\u2013 ions and is basic / alkaline with a pH greater than 7. \n \nUser Answer: \n(c)(ii): \nWhen no \\(Cu\\left(OH\\right)_2\\) is added, the universal indicator paper is red and has pH 1\u20132 because there is an excess of H+ ions.  While the \\(Cu\\left(OH\\right)_2\\) is being added, there is still an excess of H+ ions, but not as big. The pH is 4\u20135.  The paper is orange as the solution is still slightly acidic.  When the numbers of H+ and OH\u2013 ions are equal, the solution is neutralised, the paper is green and the pH is 7.  As more \\(Cu\\left(OH\\right)_2\\) is added, the universal indicator paper is now blue. The solution has an excess of OH\u2013 ions and is basic / alkaline with a pH greater than 7. \n \nCriteria: \n1: Links two pH values to correct colours. \n2: Identifies that H+ ions are neutralised as OH\u2013 ions are added. \n3: At pH 7 / neutral, \u2013 acid and base cancel out.  OR  H+ = OH\u2013 at pH 7. \n4: Links UI colours to two correct pH values and relative concentrations of ions present. \n5: Explains that once a sufficient number of OH\u2013 ions have been added to neutralise all the H+ ions (to form water), the pH equals 7. \n6: Fully explains and links the colour changes to the changing pH, relative concentration of H+ ions and OH\u2013 ions present, and neutralisation reaction occurring (pH 7 when H+ = OH\u2013 and neutral substances / water made). \n"
