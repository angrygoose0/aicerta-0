Keep in mind, one user answer might be trying to fulfil multiple criteria, ones you may or may not be given, and so the evidence may be more detailed than needed.\n    Just focus on if the specific criteria you are on is fulfilled by the user answers you are given.\n\n    When processing the input text, please pay special attention to patterns that match the LaTeX notation for inline and display equations, to ensure accurate processing of mathematical content.\n\n    Your response should be given as JSON.\n    {\"criteria\":[{\"no\":<criteria number>,\"confidence\":<confidence number>,\"explanation\":\"<explanation>\",\"quotes\":{\"<question id>\":\"<quote>\"}}]}\n\n    - Criteria Number (no): The number of the criteria being evaluated.\n    - Confidence Number (confidence): A number from 0 to 100 representing how confident you are that the USER answer fulfills the criteria. A score of 0 means you are completely confident the answer is wrong, and a score of 100 means you are 100% confident the answer is correct.\n    - Explanation (explanation): A detailed explanation of why you gave the confidence number you did.\n    - Quotes (quotes): A dictionary where each key is a question identifier and each value is a direct quote from the USER answer that fulfills the criteria. This direct quote must be accurate(punctuation and spaces)\n    NOTE: if a quote in the answer is seperated (so there are mutliple parts in the answer that qualifies the criteria), create multiple seperate JSON quote objects.\n\n    Here is an example of a possible user input:\n    Model Answer:\n    (a)(i):\n    The capital of New Zealand is Auckland.\n    (b)(i):\n    Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\n    (b)(ii):\n    Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\n    (c)(i):\n    The Earth revolves around the Sun.\n\n    User Answer:\n    (a)(i):\n    The capital of New Zealand is Tauranga.\n    (b)(i):\n    At standard pressure, water freezes at 0\u00b0C.\n    (b)(ii): \n    At standard pressure, water boils at 100\u00b0C.\n    (c)(i): The Earth likes to revolve.\n\n    Criteria:\n    1: States that the capital of New Zealand is Auckland.\n    2: States that water boils at 100 degrees celsius, and freezes at 0 degreese celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\n    3: States that the Earth revolves around the Sun.\n\n\n    Here is an example of the output:\n    {\"criteria\":[{\"no\":1,\"confidence\":0,\"explanation\":\"The response was completely incorrect, as the capital of New Zealand is NOT Tauranga.\",\"quotes\":{\"(a)(i)\":\"The capital of New Zealand is Tauranga.\"}},{\"no\":2,\"confidence\":100,\"explanation\":\"The response was completely correct, as the user states that water boils at 100 degrees celsius, and freezes at 0 degrees celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\",\"quotes\":{\"(b)(i)\":\"At 0 degrees Celsius, water,\",(b)(i)\":\"solidifying into ice under the influence of standard atmospheric pressure.\",\"(b)(ii)\":\"At standard pressure, water boils at 100\u00b0C\"}},{\"no\":3,\"confidence\":20,\"explanation\":\"The response states that the earth revolves but doesn't state around what.\",\"quotes\":{\"(c)(i)\":\"The Earth likes to revolve.\"}}]}\n    This JSON should be outputted as unformatted and with minimal whitespace.\n    "

The hydroxide ion has a charge of \u20131, so two hydroxide ions, with a combined charge of \u20132 are required to cancel out the charge on the copper ion. The carbonate ion has a charge of \u20132, so only one carbonate ion is required to cancel out the charge on the copper ion.  \n \nUser Answer: \n(a)(ii): \nCopper forms an ion with a charge of +2. It requires two negative charges to form a neutral compound. The hydroxide ion has a charge of \u20131, so two hydroxide ions, with a combined charge of \u20132 are required to cancel out the charge on the copper ion. The carbonate ion has a charge of \u20132, so only one carbonate ion is required to cancel out the charge on the copper ion. \n \nCriteria: \n1: States that overall an ionic compound has no charge. \n2: States that the +2 charge on the copper ion cancels out / balances the two \u20131 charges on the hydroxide ions. \n3: States that the +2 charge on the copper ion cancels out / balances the \u20132 charge on the carbonate ion. \n4: Explains that because the copper ion has a charge of +2 and the hydroxide ion has a charge of \u20131, the ratio of copper ions to hydroxide ions is 1:2. \n5: Explains that because the copper ion has a charge of +2 and the carbonate ion has a charge of \u20132, the ratio of copper ions to carbonate ions is 1:1.  OR   Alternative of M1 or M2 (one M point only) . OR  Explains in terms of electron transfer for one of the compounds. \n6: Fully explains the ratio of ions in both copper hydroxide AND copper carbonate in terms of the balance of positive and negative charges in the two compounds, AND must include the compounds have no charge / zero charge are neutrally charged. \n"
