Keep in mind, one user answer might be trying to fulfil multiple criteria, ones you may or may not be given, and so the evidence may be more detailed than needed.\n    Just focus on if the specific criteria you are on is fulfilled by the user answers you are given.\n\n    When processing the input text, please pay special attention to patterns that match the LaTeX notation for inline and display equations, to ensure accurate processing of mathematical content.\n\n    Your response should be given as JSON.\n    {\"criteria\":[{\"no\":<criteria number>,\"confidence\":<confidence number>,\"explanation\":\"<explanation>\",\"quotes\":{\"<question id>\":\"<quote>\"}}]}\n\n    - Criteria Number (no): The number of the criteria being evaluated.\n    - Confidence Number (confidence): A number from 0 to 100 representing how confident you are that the USER answer fulfills the criteria. A score of 0 means you are completely confident the answer is wrong, and a score of 100 means you are 100% confident the answer is correct.\n    - Explanation (explanation): A detailed explanation of why you gave the confidence number you did.\n    - Quotes (quotes): A dictionary where each key is a question identifier and each value is a direct quote from the USER answer that fulfills the criteria. This direct quote must be accurate(punctuation and spaces)\n    NOTE: if a quote in the answer is seperated (so there are mutliple parts in the answer that qualifies the criteria), create multiple seperate JSON quote objects.\n\n    Here is an example of a possible user input:\n    Model Answer:\n    (a)(i):\n    The capital of New Zealand is Auckland.\n    (b)(i):\n    Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\n    (b)(ii):\n    Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\n    (c)(i):\n    The Earth revolves around the Sun.\n\n    User Answer:\n    (a)(i):\n    The capital of New Zealand is Tauranga.\n    (b)(i):\n    At standard pressure, water freezes at 0\u00b0C.\n    (b)(ii): \n    At standard pressure, water boils at 100\u00b0C.\n    (c)(i): The Earth likes to revolve.\n\n    Criteria:\n    1: States that the capital of New Zealand is Auckland.\n    2: States that water boils at 100 degrees celsius, and freezes at 0 degreese celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\n    3: States that the Earth revolves around the Sun.\n\n\n    Here is an example of the output:\n    {\"criteria\":[{\"no\":1,\"confidence\":0,\"explanation\":\"The response was completely incorrect, as the capital of New Zealand is NOT Tauranga.\",\"quotes\":{\"(a)(i)\":\"The capital of New Zealand is Tauranga.\"}},{\"no\":2,\"confidence\":100,\"explanation\":\"The response was completely correct, as the user states that water boils at 100 degrees celsius, and freezes at 0 degrees celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.\",\"quotes\":{\"(b)(i)\":\"At 0 degrees Celsius, water,\",(b)(i)\":\"solidifying into ice under the influence of standard atmospheric pressure.\",\"(b)(ii)\":\"At standard pressure, water boils at 100\u00b0C\"}},{\"no\":3,\"confidence\":20,\"explanation\":\"The response states that the earth revolves but doesn't state around what.\",\"quotes\":{\"(c)(i)\":\"The Earth likes to revolve.\"}}]}\n    This JSON should be outputted as unformatted and with minimal whitespace.\n    "

Cl gains 1 electron to form Cl\u2013 ion, which has a charge of \u20131, as it now has 18 negative electrons and 17 positive protons.  Therefore, S2\u2013 and Cl\u2013 ions now both have the same electron arrangement of 2,8,8. \n \nUser Answer: \n(a)(iii): \nS needs to gain 2 electrons to have a full outer shell and become stable. S forms a S2\u2013 ion, which has a charge of 2\u2013, as it now has 18 negative electrons and 16 positive protons. Cl needs to gain one electron to have a full outer shell and become stable. Cl gains 1 electron to form Cl\u2013 ion, which has a charge of \u20131, as it now has 18 negative electrons and 17 positive protons.  Therefore, S2\u2013 and Cl\u2013 ions now both have the same electron arrangement of 2,8,8. \n \nCriteria: \n1: States that full outer shells are stable. Accept \u2018full valence shells\u2019 as stable for A. \n2: Defines ion, e.g. an ion is an atom that gains or loses electrons to get a full outer shell.   \n3: Correct number of protons for both.  \n4: Correct charge for both / number of electrons gained.  \n5: Explains that sulfide and chloride ions have the same electron arrangement (2,8,8), as sulfur has gained 2 electrons to get a full outer shell / become stable, and chlorine has gained one electron to get a full outer shell / to become stable.  \n6: Explains how two ions have different charge: S2\u2013 now has two more electrons than protons, and Cl\u2013 has one more electron than protons. \n7: Explains why the two ions have the same electronic arrangement: achieve stable, full outer shells by S gaining two electrons, Cl gaining one electron, and therefore having the same electron arrangement of 2,8,8  AND  Explains why two ions have the same arrangement, but a different charge: sulfide ion is S2\u2013, as it now has two more negative electrons than positive protons, and chloride ion is Cl\u2013, as it now has one more negative electron than positive protons.  \n"
