Cl needs to gain one electron to have a full outer shell and become stable. Cl gains 1 electron to form Cl– ion, which has a charge of –1, as it now has 18 negative electrons and 17 positive protons.

90944,2022,2,1,1,"As the temperature of the vinegar/ acid/ mixture  increases, the particles move faster and have more energy.

Therefore, there will be more successful collisions per second / more successful collisions will happen more frequently so rate of reaction will be faster.",4,e
90944,2022,2,2,1,"Section A: The steep line shows the reaction is fast. There are more reactant particles, so more collisions per second. More product particles are being formed, including more gas, so more gas is collected.  Section B: The line is less steep, so the reaction has slowed. There are fewer reactant particles, so fewer successful collisions per second and so less product is being made, so the volume of gas increases less quickly.  Section C: The line is horizontal so the reaction has stopped because one of the reactants has been used up, so there are no more collisions between reacting particles, so no gas is produced. ",5,n

90944,2022,2,3,2,"When water is added, the acid is diluted. In the diluted acid, there are fewer acid particles / H+ ions / vinegar particles in the same volume of the acid. Because of this, there are fewer particles available to collide with the sodium hydrogen carbonate particles. Because there are fewer to collide, less successful collisions occur per second, and the rate of reaction is slower.",11,n

When no Cu(OH)2 is added, the universal indicator paper is red and has pH 1–2 because there is an excess of H+ ions.  While the Cu(OH)2 is being added, there is still an excess of H+ ions, but not as big. The pH is 4–5.  The paper is orange as the solution is still slightly acidic.  When the numbers of H+ and OH– ions are equal, the solution is neutralised, the paper is green and the pH is 7.  As more Cu(OH)2 is added, the universal indicator paper is now blue.
