91269,2020,111,"The student correctly selects and solves one pair of simultaneous equations and identifies at least one height. Rounding errors are not penalised. For example: To find the height of the skylight for Building 1, students select \(x^2+y^2=41\text{ and }y=3x-7\). These are solved simultaneously to give the new quadratic equation \(10x^2-42x+8=0\). Solving this equation gives solutions of x of 4, 0.2. For \(x=4\) gives \(y=5\). They do not need to calculate the second y value as it does not fit the context.",a,0
