90983,2022,1,4,1,"As a result of scarcity (limited means versus unlimited wants and needs), Tama will need to make some choices. He must choose which activity or activities are the most important for him to spend (or save) his limited money. When he chooses one activity over another, e.g., chooses to buy new shoes for his collection instead of paying for a training session, he is giving up the next best alternative, which is defined as his opportunity cost. For example, choosing to buy new shoes is sacrificing paying for a training session. His opportunity cost is the training session as it is the next best alternative foregone.",8,n

90983,2022,1,,,• Identifies and defines a luxury good.,17,m
90983,2022,1,7,1,"If Tama’s income were to decrease, then his demand for the luxury / superior shoe would decrease as it would be less affordable so he would be more likely to choose a normal or inferior shoe.",18,n
90983,2022,1,,,• Correctly identifies decrease in demand if income decreases,19,a
90983,2022,1,,,• Identifies decrease in demand due to being relatively less affordable and so more likely to choose a normal / inferior good,20,m

90983,2022,2,,,"• Accurately Identifies movement down the demand curve with dotted lines, arrows, and labels.",4,a
90983,2022,2,3,1,"The law of demand states that as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases (and vice versa), assuming ceteris paribus – i.e., all other factors remain unchanged. Tama’s annual quantity demand for rugby balls will increase from 20 balls per year to 30 balls per year (Q to Q1) when the price per ball decreases from $25 to $15 (P to P1). This is because rugby balls have now become relatively less expensive for Tama than previously. Therefore, Tama can now afford to buy more balls per year with his given level of income.",5,n
90983,2022,2,,,• States that the quantity demanded will increase. • Identifies a valid reason for rugby balls being purchased.,6,a
90983,2022,2,,,"• Explains the law of demand and the idea of increased affordability, with some reference to data from the graph.",7,m
90983,2022,2,,,"• Explains the law of demand, using correct data linking to increased affordability and referring to ceteris paribus. • Refers to the changes on the graph and uses correct data and economic terminology.",8,e
90983,2022,2,4,1,"Tama’s rugby team might train with another team at the same time as they can afford more balls to train with. Tama can train more often or at more suitable times due to being able to split the squad because of increased resources. Tama’s team start winning games, win more often, or have better results due to … any other reasonable flow-on effects considered. Tama is able to spend more on other goods / services if the price decrease results in less total spending on rugby balls.",9,n

90983,2022,3,1,1,Energy drinks and sports drinks are substitutes as Tama can use either to hydrate himself / drink before or after practice. Substitutes are goods used instead of each other.,1,n

90983,2022,3,,,Identifies: • movement upwards along the demand curve for energy drinks • shifting right of demand curve for sports drinks.,6,a
90983,2022,3,3,1,"When the price of energy drinks increases from P to P1, the quantity demanded of energy drinks decreases from Q to Q1, and Tama will increase his demand for sports drinks since they are now relatively more affordable, and he substitutes energy drinks for sports drinks. The increase in demand for sports drinks is shown by a shift of the demand curve right from D to D1, meaning more sports drinks will be demanded at each and every price.",7,n
90983,2022,3,,,• Identifies more sports drinks being purchased and fewer energy drinks being purchased.,8,a

90983,2022,3,,,"• Explains shift right of the demand curve for sport drinks, with reference to the graph, and correct use of economic terms (e.g. substitutes, relative affordability). • Links increase in demand for sports drinks with decrease in QD for energy drinks",10,e
90983,2022,3,4,1,"Possible flow-on effects: • Tama could go into caffeine withdrawal from not drinking as many energy drinks. • Tama may train differently – either better due to change in what he is putting into his body, or worse as the energy drinks used to give him a boost in training. • Tama could have more money to spend on other things (if spending less money on drinks).",11,n
